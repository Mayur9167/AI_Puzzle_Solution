# AI Problem Solvers

This repository contains Python implementations of various search algorithms to solve classic AI problems.

## Included Problems/Puzzles

1. **8 Puzzle**: A sliding puzzle where tiles must be rearranged to reach a target configuration.
2. **Water Jug Problem**: Determine how to measure a specific volume using two jugs of different capacities.
3. **Missionary and Cannibals Problem**: Move missionaries and cannibals across a river without violating certain conditions.
4. **4 Queens Problem**: Place four queens on a 4x4 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.
5. **Robo Cleaner Problem**: A robot needs to clean all the dirty cells in a grid while avoiding obstacles.

## Algorithms Implemented

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- A* Search
- Hill Climbing

## Running the Code

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/Mayur9167/AI_Puzzle_Solution.git

2. Navigate/Open the directory:
   cd AI_Puzzle_Solution

3. Run command:
   python python_file_name.py

## Compatibility Note

Please note that some parts of the code might not work as expected on the Windows terminal due to differences in terminal behavior and encoding. These issues might manifest as Unicode errors, formatting discrepancies, or other unexpected behavior.

We recommend running the code on a Unix-like environment (e.g., Linux or macOS) or using a terminal emulator that is compatible with Python and supports the required encoding.
